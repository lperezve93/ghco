Position calculator

TIMEBOX:    2-3 hours max.

The purpose of this exercise is to create an application to read the simplified trade booking information in the CSV file and process them for intraday position aggregations.

The aggregation should extract cash positions (P&L) per BBGCode and per portfolio.

The position results should be verified by unit testing and displayed.

User Story: As a developer, I want to...

- Process all New trades and display the position aggregation results;

- Create an interactive way to add new trades, on top of what is loaded by the csv;

- Process all actions in the trades.csv file i.e. New, Amend and Cancel and display the results of these actions in the position aggregation results;

CLARIFICATIONS:

Cash positions can be best illustrated by an example:
BBGCode, time, side, quantity, price
ABC1, T0, B, 100, 100
ABC2, T1, B, 50, 200
ABC2, T2, B, 50, 202
ABC2, T3, S, 100, 205
ABC1, T3, S, 50, 99
Our PnL is:
ABC1 = 50*99 [Partial Sale] - 100*100 [Purchase] = -50
ABC2 = 100*205 [Full Sale] - (50*200 + 50*202) [Purchase] = 400
TOTAL = 400 - 50 = 350 PROFIT
This is a simplistic example - the provided CSV offers many more columns to break down these by.
We desire the ability to independently break down our cash positions by BBGCode and per portfolio, e.g: a screen that shows BBGCode -> Cash position and another that shows portfolio -> Cash position.

A NEW Order type is a previously unseen order.
An AMEND Order type is updating a previous order which contained incorrect information - the tradeIds will match.
A CANCEL Order type is the removal of a previous NEW (and potentially AMENDed) order.
If an order is CANCELLED it should not be included in any calculations.
If an order is AMENDED then only the most recent AMEND should be included.
Otherwise, all NEW orders should be included in the calculations.

In these calculations you should consider the SIDE of the trade as on some trade we spend cash to acquire a security and on others we are given cash for a security.
